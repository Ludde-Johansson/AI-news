## Problem Summary

I want to stay up to date on **AI for coding** without polluting or distracting my main email inbox.

### Core tensions

- I want **high-signal learning** (e.g. 1–3 good AI newsletters)
- My main inbox is for **actionable work**, not reading
- Newsletters create:
  - inbox clutter
  - unread-mail guilt
  - context switching

### Key questions

- Should I create a **separate email account** just for newsletters?
- What is the **easiest, lowest-friction provider** to use?
- Can I manage **multiple inboxes cleanly on Apple Mail**?

### Constraints / preferences

- Minimal setup and maintenance
- Ability to **batch-read intentionally**
- Easy to ignore during busy periods
- Works well with Apple Mail
- Optimized for **signal over volume**

### Desired outcome

A setup where:

- Work email stays clean
- AI newsletters are isolated
- Reading feels optional and deliberate, not stressful
